				<h2>【Your Character】</h2>
				<h3>【Concept】</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
						Your <b>Concept</b> describes who and what you are, and determines how the Spiral and its denizens perceive you. For example, <i>Charismatic Swashbuckler</i> 
					</p>
				</div>
				<h3>【Flaw】</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
						Your <b>Flaw</b> is a personality quirk, ailment, or anything else that gets you into trouble. By invoking your Flaw, you may remove Stress. For example, <i>Tends to ramble</i> 
					</p>
				</div>
				<h3>【Essence Dice】</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
						<b>Essence Dice</b> are a pool of five 10-sided dice you use during <b>Conflict</b> to spend on <b>Actions</b> and <b>Reactions</b> each Round. 
						Actions are flexible to give the choice to be aggressive or defensive and can be delayed or split, but any unspent dice are lost at the end of the Round.   
					</p>
				</div>
				<h3>【Stress】</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
						<b>Stress</b> represents physical damage, mental fatigue, luck running out, and other consequences. All PCs have 8 <b>Stress Boxes</b>; 5 of which are <i>Light</i> with the remaining 3 <i>Heavy</i>. These are noted as □ and ■ respectively.<br><br>
						Upon taking damage you must check off a number of Stress Boxes equal to the damage where one Light Box is equal to 1 damage and one Heavy Box is equal to 2 damage.<br><br>
						Upon checking off all Stress Boxes, you gain 1 <span class="decay_text">Decay</span>.
					</p>
				</div>
				<h3>【Setbacks】</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
						<b>Setbacks</b> are consequences caused by checking off a Heavy Stress Box. Some examples include broken equipment, an injury that causes you trouble, sealed Rhetoric, or some other complication.   
					</p>
				</div>
				<h3>【Attributes】</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
						<b>Attributes</b> represent your wretched’s ability and used whenever you make a Check. 
						There are four <b>Primary Attributes</b> which can be improved by spending XP, and three <b>Secondary Attributes</b> which are increased indirectly<br><br>

						</ul>

					</p>

				<h3>【Skills】</h3>

				</div>
				<h3>【Notes】</h3>

					</p>
				</div>
				<!-- Playing the Game -->
				<h2>【Playing the Game】</h2>
				<h3>【Checks】</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
						Choose an appropriate <b>Attribute</b> and roll any amount of remaining <b>Essence Dice</b> (Checks outside of Conflict always use 5 dice), then compare the results to the Attribute.<br>
						Each result <i>less than or equal to</i> the Attribute count as a success.<br>
						Results of 1 always succeed and results of 9 and 10 always fail regardless of any Bonuses or Penalties.<br><br>
						<b>Free Checks</b><br>
						Uses only one die but does not consume any Essence Dice. Always pass or fail.<br><br>
						<b>Bonuses and Penalties</b><br>
						Each <b>Bonus</b> increases your Attribute by 1. For example, a +1 Bonus towards a <span class="body_text">Body</span>(4) Check will succeed on results of 5 or lower.<br><br>
						Each <b>Penalty</b> decreases your Attribute by 1. For example, a -2 Penalty towards a <span class="mind_text">Mind</span>(5) Check will only succeed on results of 3 or under.
					</p>
				</div>
				<h3>【Wealth Checks】</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
						To purchase an item or service, you must make a Check using <span class="wealth_text">Wealth</span> as the Attribute. 
						If the number of successes match or succeed the DR of the item/service, you purchase it successfully and suffer no consequence. Otherwise, the transaction has failed.<br>
						However, you may turn failed rolls into successes by reducing your <span class="wealth_text">Wealth</span> by 1 for each success.
					</p>
				</div>
				<h3>【Invoking Your Flaw】</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
						You may invoke your <b>Flaw</b> by putting yourself into a significant narrative disadvantage. In doing so, you may recover checked <b>Stress Boxes</b> based on how much trouble you are in; the more trouble, the more you recover.
