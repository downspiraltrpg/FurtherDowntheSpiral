					<p>
						Where do legends go when they are forgotten? Stories that people no longer tell? They all end up here, in the Spiral.<br><br>
						<b>Further Down the Spiral</b> is a fantasy RPG where players take on the role of <i>wretcheds</i>, personifications of forgotten legends. 
						Here, they must cling to their existence in a world literally spiraling towards oblivion. Will you spread your legend or perish in the attempt?

				<h2>【Features】</h2>
				<div>
					<ul>
						<li>Players may create their own custom abilities via the <b>Rhetoric</b> system, allowing them to make truly unique characters. Contains several guidelines and a list of premade Rhetoric.</li>
						<li>In Conflict, each participant gains a number of dice which they may spend on <b>Actions</b> and <b>Reactions</b>. Turning a quick potshot into a carefully aimed snipe is as simple as adding more dice to your attack.</li>
						<li><b>Combat Zones</b> keep combat simple yet tactical and eliminate the need to use a grid.</li>
						<li>Rules for <b>Stealth</b> and <b>Social Conflict</b>. By using <b>Special Points</b> (<b>SP</b>) you are not instantly discovered for failing a single Stealth Check.</li>
						<li>All types of <b>Equipment</b> have distinct advantages / disadvantages rather than simple damage calculations. For example, a sword can be used to defend in melee, whereas axes give bonuses to all out attacks.</li>
						<li>Use the <b>Unknown Spiral Generation</b> rules to create new areas and challenges on the fly.</li>
						<li>8 <b>Covenants</b> that grant mechanical and narrative benefits for joining.</li>
					</ul>
